# Sorting-Algorithm-Visualizer
A Sorting Algorithm program inspired by Tech With Tim Sorting Algorithm Visualizer, developed with Python 3.10.
It contains Merge Sort, Quick Sort, Insertion Sort, Bubble Sort visualization.
The visualization can be done ascending or descending. It also offers a feature to slow down/ speed
up the visualization by increasing/decreasing the FPS of the program.

Instruction on how to load the program  

`pip install -r requirements.txt`  
`python main.py`  

Alternatively, you can run the precompiled version of the program in dist/main.exe. Pyinstaller is in requirements.txt
since I compiled the program into an executable whenever a new feature is developed. The only dependency of this program
is pygame.
